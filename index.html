                <p>A space rocket is a means of transport for taking astronauts, equipment and satellites into Earth orbit (or out into space). To fulfill this purpose, the craft needs a jet engine.

                    It's just that there's no oxygen in space, so you can't use conventional engines. To get around this, fuels charge your oxygen supply. Without this, combustion would not take place. And the ship would stay in place.</p>
                <br>
                <p> Earth's gravitational pull is strong. To escape from it, the rocket consumes an enormous amount of energy. The SaturnV, for example, managed to climb more than 100 km in a few minutes, with a force of almost 35 million newtons. That's how he took the first astronauts to the moon.</p>

                <p>There are three types of rocket, classified according to the type of fuel used. Are they:
                    <br>
                    - Solid fuel rocket: compacted powder with a mixture of dry fuels and strong oxidizers, capable of releasing a lot of oxygen in combustion;
                    <br>
                    - Liquid fuel rocket: chambers separate fuel from oxidizers, which only mix during ignition (when the rocket “turns on”). The most commonly used are hydrazine and liquid hydrogen.
                    <br>
                    - Hybrid fuel rocket: fuels and oxidizers are in separate chambers and in different states (liquid/solid or gaseous/solid).</p>
                <br>

                </figure>
                <p>All existing rockets that have flown, to date, are chemical ones. To work, they release chemical energy into their fuel through combustion. But there are other types of rocket engines.</p>

                <br>
                <p>"There are dozens of rocket launch sites around the world. Most of them, however, are found in the Northern Hemisphere and along the Equator. at the Equator, the Earth revolves around itself at a speed of approximately 1600 km/h.</p>
                <br>
                <p>"In recent years, companies like SpaceX have invested in rocket technologies that are capable of automatically landing on the ground, further lowering the costs involved in launching them."</p>
