        <p>For a rocket to launch, it needs to overcome the force of gravity acting on it. To do this, it produces an upward force (thrust) that “fights” against the force that is pulling it down (gravity).

            To produce the thrust force, the rocket engines produce combustion gases, usually using liquid hydrogen as fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidant, these gases are expelled through the rocket nozzles, pushing against the upper wall of the nozzles. The relationship between the forces can be summarized by Newton's third law, in which every action causes a reaction of equal force and opposite direction, the gases are expelled with such force that it overcomes the weight of the rocket, propelling it upwards. . We can use the following equation to demonstrate:
           
            E – P = m . The
           
            Where: 'E' is the thrust, 'P' is the weight of the rocket, 'm' is its total mass and 'a' is the acceleration of the rocket.
           
            The initial acceleration needed to propel the rocket can be calculated by the equation: E = m . The. For the rocket to overcome gravity, the initial acceleration needs to be greater than the gravitational acceleration, which on the earth's surface is 9.8 m/s².
           
            The lower the mass of the rocket, the less thrust required to launch it. That is why studies regarding the material of the rocket and, mainly, the type of fuel are so important.</p>
